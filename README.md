# Vimeo Video Links

Simple WordPress plugin that provides you with shortcodes to get a download url of a Vimeo Video.

## Shortcodes

`[vimeo_video_button id="vimeo_video_id" quality="hd"]`

`[vimeo_video_url id="vimeo_video_id" quality="hd"]`

Both shortcodes accept an id and quality attribute. If quality is left empty, the highest available quality is used.
